# Game Revenue Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of game revenue data based on a task that required adding various calculated columns and metrics to a dataset. The analysis was performed using Google Sheets.

## Project Description

The project involved the following tasks:

1. **Data Enrichment:** Added columns to calculate various metrics such as:

   - **Total Revenue**: The total revenue generated by each game.
   - **Paid Users Count**: The total number of paying users.
   - **CR to Paid**: Conversion rate from users to paying users (in percentage).
   - **ARPPU**: Average revenue per paying user.
   - **Average Age (paid users)**: Average age of paying users.
   - **Median Age (paid users)**: Median age of paying users.
   - **Minimum Age (paid users)**: Minimum age of paying users.
   - **Maximum Age (paid users)**: Maximum age of paying users.

2. **Total Row:** Added a summary row at the bottom of the table to calculate the total values for all metrics across all games.

3. **Analysis and Conclusions:**
   - Discussed why games marked as numbers 1 and 2 might have a lower CR to Paid.
   - Investigated the reasons for differences in ARPPU between the games.
   - Proposed hypotheses and testing strategies.
   - Provided recommendations for the game manager of game number 2.

## Summary and Conclusions

### 1. Why might games 1 and 2 have a lower CR to Paid?

The lower CR to Paid for games 1 and 2 can be attributed to the low number of paying users. The potential reasons for this include:

- Insufficient funds allocated for advertising or an inappropriate marketing strategy.
- Features that do not encourage players to make purchases.
- Pricing that is less attractive to players.

### 2. What could be the reason for the difference in ARPPU between games?

The ARPPU for game 3 is approximately $56, which is more than 4 times higher than for game 2 and more than 7 times higher than for game 1. Possible reasons for why users of game 3 spend more on average include:

- Different premium purchase/subscription models in the game.
- Differences in the target audience. Different genres of games may attract players with different attitudes toward spending.
- Game 3 may have a more engaged player community, more willing to spend money.
- Game 3 has the widest player age range, from 14 to 44 years.
- The games might be at different stages of development; for example, game 3 may already have an established market presence, while game 1 might be a new offering still building its audience.

### 3. How would you test your hypotheses?

To test the earlier hypotheses, I could conduct A/B tests to measure the effectiveness of various marketing strategies in the games and determine which strategies generate higher ARPPU and CR to Paid.

### 4. What recommendations would you give to the managers of game 2?

For the manager of game 2, who wishes to increase ARPPU and CR to Paid, I would recommend:

- Analyzing the business model of game 2 and comparing it with other business models used in the industry.
- Checking whether the in-game offers are attractive to players and appropriately priced, and then finding the most player-preferred offer through A/B testing.
- Ensuring that the value-for-money ratio is perceived as high by players. The quality of paid content should be as high as possible.
- Developing a strategy focused on retaining loyal paying users.
- Regularly monitoring ARPPU and CR to Paid data.
